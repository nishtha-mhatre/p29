. Take 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, Â½ tsp chaat masala powder, 1 to 2 green chilies (chopped) in a chutney grinder jar. I usually add 2 to 3 green chilies as we prefer a bit spicy chutney in the sandwiches. You can also add half-half of coriander leaves and mint leaves. Just add a pinch or two of salt, as chaat masala already has salt in it.

. Grind the chutney ingredients till smooth. no need to add water. But if you cannot grind, then add 1 or 2 tsp of water. I did not add water as there was enough moisture after rinsing the coriander leaves to help them grind to a smooth chutney.

3. Collect the coriander chutney in a bowl. Check the taste and add more salt if required. Cover and keep the chutney aside if you are making sandwiches immediately or else refrigerate. If not using immediately, sprinkle a few drops of lemon or lime juice, so that the chutney color does not darken.
